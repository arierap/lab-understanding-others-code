The_Hangman_FV_Refactored

Based on the old version of my Disney Hangman delivered on Week1, I reflected and I also requested my colleague Robin Langlois feedback to re-do the game and improve it. The key things we decide to modify to imporve the game are the following:

FUNCTIONS. On the initial version of the game, everything was done by different steps within Jupyter Notebook. This lead to a fractured experience with the game which was not user friendly. I have redone the game via functions, and now the expreience itÂ´s much more flawless since all the stepped functions link with each other.

DOCSTRING. I have decided to include documentation within my functions for my use and potentially other people that might read my code. This has made the process of creating functions much more easy since I have included inputs and returns related to each function.

READING THE DATA. Regarding the data, at the moment the function is calling a small text file including a small list of Disney Classic Movie titles. One potential improvement for the future would be to read the database from a cloud if we wanted to extend the game to bigger databases. ie. All movies, song titles, animals, etc...
